# 🏆 ArcheRage Collections Tracker

A high-performance, data-driven progress tracker built specifically for the **ArcheRage NA** community. Track your journey from a novice collector to a world-class completionist.

## 🛠️ Advanced Features
- **Smart Progress Logic:** Multi-tiered tracking that calculates progress for individual sub-categories, grandparent collections, and your overall account completion—including hidden "Bonus" points for finishing sets.
- **Visual Feedback System:** Integrated "Completion Glow" — sections dynamically change color and border styles the moment they hit 100% completion.
- **Persistent Data Layer:** Uses browser-based storage with 0% latency, plus a full **JSON Export/Import** engine to ensure you never lose your progress when switching PCs.
- **Focused Hunting:** "Show Uncollected Only" filter uses real-time DOM manipulation to hide finished items, letting you focus entirely on your remaining goals.
